# emotions_inmusic
These are the archives of my bachelor's degree project about Emotions in music. The project deals with the characterization and the classification of the emotions expressed by music. The analysis has been done from a sonologic perspective, considering that the aim of the project is trying to discover if these emotions are differently perceived when we listen the different part of a song separately (voice, instrumentation, voice and instrumentation together) in respect of listening the whole song produced.

These are the archives included in the repository:

• Emo_database.zip: Soundtracks collection of different music styles able to transmit different emotional reactions/stimulus, by whom i have extracted 4 different versions: voice, instrumentation, voice + instrumentation and mix.
• PsyToolkit_script.txt: PsyToolkit script used for subjects evaluation.
• CSV1.csv i 5CSV1.csv: .csv (comma separated values) archives with the results of the subjects evaluation.
• Essentia_com.txt: command-line instructions for Essentia's library running. 
• Praat_script.txt: Praat script used for automation of voice features extraction.
• Weka_Dades.csv: .csv archive with the results of the subjects evaluation and the results of music extraction.
