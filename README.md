# emotions_inmusic
These are the archives of my bachelor's degree project about Emotions in music. The project deals with the characterization and the classification of the emotions expressed by music. The analysis has been done from a sonologic perspective, considering that the aim of the project is trying to discover if these emotions are differently perceived when we listen the different part of a song separately (voice, instrumentation, voice and instrumentation together) in respect of listening the whole song produced.
